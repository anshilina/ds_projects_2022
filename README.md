|  Modeling the process of gold mining | We will build the best ML model for a company that develop effective strategies for industrial enterprises. The model should predict the proportion of gold that could be recovered from gold ore. We will use input and output data parameters collected at different stages of gold mining. The model will help to optimize production and not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics. | *pandas, numpy, IPython, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn*|
|Choosing region for oil well drill site|Oil company needs to decide where to drill a new well. We have to chose the best region.There is data on oil samples in three regions: 10,000 observations in each region, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves were measured. To choose region, where mining will be the most profitable, we will use ML models. Profit and risks will be analyzed using *bootstrap sampling*.| *pandas, numpy, sklearn, IPython, matplotlib, seaborn*|
|Bank customers attrition analysis |There are loss of clients in "Beta Bank". According to bank data, it is cheaper to keep current customers than to attract new ones. Therefore, our **goal** is to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Using the data on customers we will classify them on those who will leave and will not. We have to fit classification model and get at least 0.59 of the F1-score. In addition, we will check AUC-ROC.|*pandas, random, numpy, sklearn, imblearn, matplotlib, seaborn*|
| Advertising campaign for the play store | In this research, we use open data on game sales, users' and experts' ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation). We need to analyze data, determine the factors of the game success, identify a potentially popular product and develop recommendations for the advertising campaign of the game store. | *pandas, scipy, IPython, matplotlib, seaborn*|
|Research on the recommendation of mobile tariffs|We have data on customers who have already switched to "Smart" or "Ultra" mobile plan. We need to model the classification of tariff. Our model should select the most suitable tariff using the users' characteristics.|*pandas, IPython, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn*|
|Mobile plans research|The clients of the federal mobile operator are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff is more profitable.|*numpy, pandas, IPython, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy*|
|Protection of the personal information provided by customers|We have to select and use data transformation method so that 1) it will be difficult to restore personal information and 2) the quality of the model does not change.|*pandas, numpy, random, seaborn, matplotlib, IPython, sklearn*|
|Exploring sales advertising in the housing market in St. Petersburg |In this project, data provided by the Yandex.Realty service is studied. There are ads of apartments for sale in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements over several years. We need to establish parameters that will be used in automated system that monitors outliers and fraudulent activity.|*re, pandas, numpy, statistics, seaborn, IPython, matplotlib*|
|Study of debtors' reliability|In this project, we examine the relationship between income, work experience, number of family members, and other characteristics of borrowers and their ability to return loans on time.|*pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy*|
